2. You can change all the parameters of TCC calculation or just leave it as default. Click `[Run TCC Calculation]` button and wait for calculation finished.

  Besides, you can copy and save the **R code of TCC calculation** (under `[TCC Parameters]` panel) in the purpose of code studying or reproducing the same results on a local machine.   
4. Next, **Step3** & **Step4** tabs will show up in the side bar. **Step3** is for data exploration, visualization and analysis while **Step4** is for outputs. you can choose any of them for the next step of your analysis.
